# 🍔 Swiggy Frontend Clone

This project is a frontend clone of the Swiggy food delivery application built using React.js.  
It focuses on replicating the core user interface and frontend behavior of the Swiggy platform.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The Swiggy Frontend Clone demonstrates how a real-world food delivery website is structured using React’s component-based architecture.  
Restaurant data is rendered dynamically, and users can search for restaurants using a search bar.

This project is created only for learning and practice purposes.
